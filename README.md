# Honey Encryption

Honey encryption is a form of data encryption that generates a ciphertext that, when 	decrypted with an incorrect key guessed by the attacker, displays a plausible-	looking yet incorrect plaintext password or encryption key.

It adds an extra layer of security to encrypted data by serving up false data in 	response to each incorrect guess of the password or encryption key.
